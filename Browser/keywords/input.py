        Difference compared to `Input Text` is that this keyword does not
        log the given password on the INFO level. Notice that if you use
        the keyword like
        | Input Password | password_field | password |
        the password is shown as a normal keyword argument. A way to avoid
        that is using variables like
        | Input Password | password_field | ${PASSWORD} |
        Please notice that Robot Framework logs all arguments using
        the TRACE level and tests must not be executed using level below
        DEBUG if the password should not be logged in any format.
